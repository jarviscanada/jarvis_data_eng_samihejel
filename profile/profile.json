The tech industry in particular really interests me because of how it's always changing and evolving. As someone who really enjoys the process of learning this is huge for me because it provides the opportunity to constantly be learning something new and honing my skills. I'm also drawn to the problem solving aspect of the industry. I actually had no coding experience prior to university and I ended up picking Computer Science based on the fact that it led to a career where I could be challenged and constantly solve problems."
