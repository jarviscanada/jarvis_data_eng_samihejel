# Samih Ejel . Jarvis Consulting

Hey there my name is Samih (it's pronounced like sammy). I'm a recent Computer Science grad from Ontario Tech University and I'm super pumped to take my first steps into the industry. Python is definitely my language of choice since I've spent so much of my time at school using it and because I think the readability of the language makes it a lot easier to focus on the problem solving aspect of coding. I've also spent a decent portion of my degree working with Java and C++. I'm someone who really enjoys the process of learning and actively seek out new technologies to dip my toes into and try out. My goal as a developer is to contribute to something that affects others in a positive way.
